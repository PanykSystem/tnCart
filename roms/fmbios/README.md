## FM BIOS ROM

This is a ROM file that allows applications to detect OPLL.
When using OPLL, you need to write this ROM file to address 120000h using "Gowin Programmer".

This ROM does not support BASIC statements and instrument data read from the ROM.
Gowin Programmer will not work properly unless you change the ROM file extension to ".bin".
